# JG Final Capstone Example

This directory contains the same starter code you will receive for the final capstone. We will use this to build out our final JG Homes VUE app. The server side is 
the same backend code from M2 final review, just slightly reorganized (package-wise) so it aligns with the directory structure. 

Each project contains instructions that provides information about the starting code and explains how to get started with the final capstone project.
