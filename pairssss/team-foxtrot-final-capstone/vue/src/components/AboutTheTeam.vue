            Before Tech Elevator, she was a manager at a trampoline park. In her free time
            she reads, plays violin and spends time outside. She would
            eventually like to be in a position that uses tech as a tool to help
            people access the resources they need, which was the inspiration for LifeLine.

            <h4>Scrum Master</h4>

          <p>
            Scott was an academic fellow this cohort (just like a real-life
            Clippy ðŸ“Ž). He is a Tech Elevator alum who worked as the insightful inspiration of a scrum master
            for this project. He has a background in construction, and is a native 
            New Yorker. His support through GIFs in homework assignment grades kept 
            many students alive, along with his cat sweaters. Thank you, Scott!

            <h4>Product Manager</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            Steve was the amazing and willful Product Manager for this project, in his 15th cohort as
            an instructor. Before that, he worked just over 23'ish years as a
            developer, tech lead, and solutions architect at several places and has
            the gray hairs to prove it. On the side, he coaches at his own sports
            performance company where he privately works with
            athletes to improve their strength, speed and endurance. He also
            works with adult runners in distances from just getting started to
            50-100 mile ultra races and everything in between. Thank you, Steve!
